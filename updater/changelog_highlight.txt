[!] First off I'd like to start by saying some of you don't understand what
Unmonitored Google does. Unmonitored Google just makes what you search not
traceable to your Google account. It does NOT unblock sites and will most
likely not work if you open a website on it.
[!] I also noticed a lot of you really want proxies. I *may* do this in
the future, but for right now this isn't 100% planned.
[!] I really appreciate all the feedback and bug reports you guys are
submitting, it really does help. (:
