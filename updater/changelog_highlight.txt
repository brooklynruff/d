[!] Hey! I'm probably going to take a small break from adding suggestions.
It's been getting a little much, suggestion form will still be up but I'm
probably going to slow down and work on some other features and bugs first.
I appreciate all the suggestions though! It's just with all the new users
and everything it's been getting a little much, I'm a solo developer after
all.
[+] Fixed Talking Angela (Thanks for the bug report Jonathon)
[-] Removed Moto X3M & Moto X3M Winter due to them being broken. Will
re-add when I decide to fix them. (Thanks for the bug report zekes37)
