                             Changelog & About

----------------------------------ABOUT US----------------------------------
This site was started with one vision: cut out the unnecessary stuff and st-
ick to what people care about; unblocked games. No Name Games is the most a-
dvanced unblocked games website, utilizing the best bypassing techniques, p-
aired with the best functionality. Most unblocked games websites  are  built
with Elmer's glue and prayers, whilst No Name Games has stayed on top of the
game since we started. We've been going strong since November of 2024, gett-
ing around every obstacle placed in our way in a matter of hours. We haven't
been stopped yet and it won't happen anytime soon. No Name Games was made by
an actual competent developer who knows what they're doing,  which is a rare
sight in the unblocked games world.  The current competition is dominated by
people who don't  have a clue  what they're doing and use ChatGPT to  "code"
their infrastructure. No Name Games has and will stay on top of the competi-
tion.

11/10/2025:
[-] Okay looks like I'm changing my mind once again. The proxy has been
removed. Sorry.
[!] This experiment didn't work out the way I expected, so proxies might be
delayed for the future again.

11/09/2025:
[+] Alright it looks like I'm changing my mind. I added a proxy, but it may
be blocked for some people (if it is don't submit a bug report).
[!] Please, don't abuse the proxy!

11/07/2025:
[-] Removed Edubrain.ai due to it being blocked, may come back if I develop
a proxy.
[!] Regarding proxies, I still do not want to add a proxy unless I can fully
make it unblockable. The whole point of No Name Games is for everything to 
be untouchable, but a proxy does not do that. I know I kinda contradicted
myself with edubrain.ai, but it was unblocked for a long time, lol. Also
again, I don't make money from No Name Games and webservers cost money.

nonamegamescontact@proton.me, it'd be greatly appreciated.

multiplayer-only. (Maybe a little faster than 1.12.2!)

not load.
[+] Made the "Contact" button at the top scroll to the contact information.
[+] Added Friday Night Funkin' (Thanks for the suggestion!)

'Open Bug Report Form' opening the suggestion form. My bad.
[+] Added Minecraft 1.12.2 [If the other Minecraft versions are laggy use
this.]
[+] Added Doki Doki Literature Club (Thanks for the suggestion Theo) [...

09/23/2025:
[!] First off I'd like to start by saying some of you don't understand what
Unmonitored Google does. Unmonitored Google just makes what you search not
traceable to your Google account. It does NOT unblock sites and will most
likely not work if you open a website on it.
[!] I also noticed a lot of you really want proxies. I *may* do this in
the future, but for right now this isn't 100% planned.
[!] I really appreciate all the feedback and bug reports you guys are
submitting, it really does help. (:
