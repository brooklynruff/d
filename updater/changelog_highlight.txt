[-] Removed Edubrain.ai due to it being blocked, may come back if I develop a proxy.
[!] Regarding proxies, I still do not want to add a proxy unless I can fully make it unblockable. The whole point of No Name Games is for everything to be untouchable, but a proxy does not do that. I know I kinda contradicted myself with edubrain.ai, but it was unblocked for a long time, lol. Also again, I don't make money from No Name Games and webservers cost money.
