                             Changelog & About

----------------------------------ABOUT US----------------------------------
This site was started with one vision: cut out the unnecessary stuff and st-
ick to what people care about; unblocked games. No Name Games is the most a-
dvanced unblocked games website, utilizing the best bypassing techniques, p-
aired with the best functionality. Most unblocked games websites  are  built
with Elmer's glue and prayers, whilst No Name Games has stayed on top of the
game since we started. We've been going strong since November of 2024, gett-
ing around every obstacle placed in our way in a matter of hours. We haven't
been stopped yet and it won't happen anytime soon. No Name Games was made by
an actual competent developer who knows what they're doing,  which is a rare
sight in the unblocked games world.  The current competition is dominated by
people who don't  have a clue  what they're doing and use ChatGPT to  "code"
their infrastructure. No Name Games has and will stay on top of the competi-
tion.
==================================CHANGELOG=================================
11/12/2025:
[+] Added Half-Life 1 (Thanks for the suggestion ThatOneAmerican!)

11/11/2025:
[+] Added Super Mario Bros. 1 & 3 (Thanks for the suggestion!)
[+] Added Spongebob's Truth or Square (Thanks for the suggestion!)
[+] Added Mario Paint (Thanks for the suggestion!)
[+] Added Pokémon FireRed (Thanks for the suggestion!)
[+] Added Papa's Wingeria (Thanks for the suggestion Kimmy J!)
[+] Added Nazi Zombies Portable (Thanks for the suggestion) [I suppose this
is what you mean by "Call of Duty Zombies Browser Edition"]
[+] Added Pokémon Emerald (I accidentally deleted the suggestion before
writing your name, sorry)
[+] Added a warning when trying to click my email (Please read it if you've
emailed me before)

11/10/2025:
[-] Okay looks like I'm changing my mind once again. The proxy has been
removed. Sorry.
[!] This experiment didn't work out the way I expected, so proxies might be
delayed for the future again.

11/09/2025:
[+] Alright it looks like I'm changing my mind. I added a proxy, but it may
be blocked for some people (if it is don't submit a bug report).
[!] Please, don't abuse the proxy!

11/07/2025:
[-] Removed Edubrain.ai due to it being blocked, may come back if I develop
a proxy.
[!] Regarding proxies, I still do not want to add a proxy unless I can fully
make it unblockable. The whole point of No Name Games is for everything to 
be untouchable, but a proxy does not do that. I know I kinda contradicted
myself with edubrain.ai, but it was unblocked for a long time, lol. Also
again, I don't make money from No Name Games and webservers cost money.

11/06/2025:
[+] Added Hotline Miami 1 (Thanks for the suggestion o-333)
[+] Added Metroid Fusion (Thanks for the suggestion Franklin)
[+] Added Metroid Mission Zero (Thanks for the suggestion Franklin)
[+] Made FNAF 1 a better version (Thanks for the bug report)

11/05/2025:
[!] I noticed people talking about the site freezing, if anyone experiencing
this issue can email me a video of it happening, please send it to
nonamegamescontact@proton.me, it'd be greatly appreciated.
[+] Made Minecraft 1.8.8 use web assembly (WASM) making it faster, and not
multiplayer-only. (Maybe a little faster than 1.12.2!)
[+] Fixed the email button opening my email in the same page, causing it to
not load.
[+] Made the "Contact" button at the top scroll to the contact information.
[+] Added Friday Night Funkin' (Thanks for the suggestion!)
[+] Fixed Bad Piggies (Thanks for the bug report Theo)

11/04/2025:
[+] Fixed the 'Open Suggestion Form' opening the bug report form and the
'Open Bug Report Form' opening the suggestion form. My bad.
[+] Added Minecraft 1.12.2 [If the other Minecraft versions are laggy use
this.]
[+] Added Doki Doki Literature Club (Thanks for the suggestion Theo) [...
you guys are some weird individuals.]

11/01/2025:

09/27/2025:
[!] Hey! I'm probably going to take a small break from adding suggestions.
It's been getting a little much, suggestion form will still be up but I'm
probably going to slow down and work on some other features and bugs first.
I appreciate all the suggestions though! It's just with all the new users
and everything it's been getting a little much, I'm a solo developer after
all.
[+] Fixed Talking Angela (Thanks for the bug report Jonathon)

Freezeria, Hot Doggeria, Pancakeria, Pastaria, Pizzeria, and Scooperia)
[+] Fixed Acid Bunny (Thanks for the bug report)

09/23/2025:
[!] First off I'd like to start by saying some of you don't understand what
Unmonitored Google does. Unmonitored Google just makes what you search not
traceable to your Google account. It does NOT unblock sites and will most
likely not work if you open a website on it.
[!] I also noticed a lot of you really want proxies. I *may* do this in
the future, but for right now this isn't 100% planned.
[!] I really appreciate all the feedback and bug reports you guys are
submitting, it really does help. (:

face the same thing, I have them backed up just in case.

05/08/2025:
